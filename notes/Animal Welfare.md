# Animal Welfare

<aside>
📌 Where’s your place in nature? Egocentric or controlled? Western Philosophy tends to hold up an egocentric view. Buddhism  and Jainism revere life, and a large number of them are encouraged by their religion on the other hand to not eat meat

# Some books and works

David Grazia -> books about issues in animal human relations. Prof of philosophy
Marc beckoff —>  the emotional lives of animals made people sympathetic to animals
Frans de Waal —> drew similarities between animals and us that made people sympathetic to their situation.

*Condition of animals in the western world.*

- 19th century research used to do research on animals without anaesthesia. Which triggered a lot of protest!
- Environmental concerns about pollution of the plant
- Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring; Earth Day, 1970
- Philosopher Peter Singer’s Animal Liberationâ€ (1975) [animals rights should be based on their capacity to feel pain more than on their intelligence]

Temple Grandin -> autistic -> sensitive senses + thought in pictures -> her perspective made her sympathetic to animals and became a prof.

- cows are prey species, prods are used to make them move, but the reason why they don’t wan to move is that they see threats in the puddles of water after the rain, so if you smooth over the ground the cow would just go
- guidelines, less than 10, easy to implement
- public pressure + easy guidelines, macdonalds committed to doing it

Civet Coffee —> an extremely cruel tradition of kopi luak because they mistreat the civets for the economic opportunities because they brand it well.

## Laws of the states

- every animal owner must provide suitable food and water and shelter for the animal, section 41.

## Laws not enough: animal welfare groups fill the gap

## Cats

146 SPCA: killing 12-16 thousand cats a year -> not working as a mechanism to manage the animals. These stats shows that their method was not working!! It inspired a trap neuter release method.

Rumours that cats could carry the disease during SARS.

Community cats -> once called stray cats -> the feeders gain trust, then they do sterilisation when they have the trust and know individual relationships, and every time they cut the ears you know they’re sterilised -> management factor of returning the cats to the same estate with their feeder -> the cats only bother their feeder, and they stay in the ecosystem and prevent others

AVA stray cat rehabilitation scheme -> people were scared of SARs, there was a rumour that cats were spreading it. And cats were being poisoned and they vanished and taken away-> cats were brought into homes to protect them -> initiative to ‘rehabilitate’ cats disappeared very fast as it was not evidence based, it was rumour based.

Today its different: not pandemic panic, they’ve reached out to help the animal welfare groups. Also, people started to worry when they saw cats being taken, then posted on Facebook, but the reality was not like in SARs, feeders explained that cats were being abandoned their estates. So NParks trapped these new cats and gave the new cats care and support and tried to make sure they got adopted.

=> find out the cat feeder networks and make sure they know what the taking the cats away about to avoid this kind of panic.

# Gov change

Now government agencies(NParks AVS - animal and veterinary services) are more knowledgeable and they want to help with humane and science-based policies, with agencies and town councils. Bc town councils have like pet control agencies right.

- (Primary production environment -> brutally round up animals. Then AVA became more humane. AVA announced in 2016 they would build a single facility with government in charge of the leases to be safer)
- Culling of wild pigs stopped In 2019, when AVA functions were absorbed by NParks which became the lead agency for animal and wildlife management.

Lab mice checks -> previously, if you didn’t treat the animals right no one would care, but now they do because of the law that was passed, and now lab mice in NUS have stronger protections than even pets!

New pet owners infographics and document of what is required of you by law, as well as their diet, care, handling and even transporting. Monthly

289: Pet business used to be openly condoned because economic incentive to allow breeders to exist. But now there are more regulations. Some countries only adopted animals can exist.

206: TRNM for dogs instead of culling, as they might’ve had in the past. Teaching feeders how to feed responsibly.

For animals that can be rehomed, they will try. Trial for HDB pets (Project ADORE)

## *Pet Abandonment*

- Microchipping is required for pet dogs, so that if a dog is abandoned they can contact the owner and figure it out
- spike in abandonment around certain points of time.
- Factory farming * is particularly horrible but he won’t talk about it. Lab grown meat has happened and is approved in Singapore —> so if public acceptance happens this might help to remove incentive for factory farms

# *NUS organisations*

- NUS Peace
- NUS cat cafe (care about the animals)
- Paw friends
- Therapy Dogs Programme
- NUS VEGE (even not eating meat for one meal a day can have a big impact) -> RVRC the sustainability college

## Exploitation of Elephants for tourism

- Use of elephants in tourism encourages the capture of wild Asian elephants, an endangered species whose population is in decline.
- Managing a domestic elephant often involves fear and mistreatment by the use of bull-hooks to control animals.
- Elephants are taken from their families, isolated and “tamed”.
- Young elephants are tortured in a process called Phajaan or “the crush” to break its spirit to allow the unnatural act of humans riding on its back.
