## 419: asexual vs having sex

Asexual

- asexual reproduction ‚Äî> like cloning ‚Äî> when good set of genes and individual is supremely adapted to his particular condition. ‚Äî> no loss of genetic information, everything that the origin or the source had you're going to find in the clone.
  - budding with bacteria
  - fragmenting where each fragment becomes a new individual
  - parthogenesis in reptiles (snakes, lizards, sharks ‚Äî pit viper, komodo dragon)
    - reptiles might have a particular affinity to be able to switch to parthenogenesis in a resource starved situation
    - okay for zoos bc habitat is well adapted for animal

Sexual:

- Have variability
  - this variability means there's more than one way to solve problems which clones would only have one way.
- Mixing of genes from both parents who have already done well in the environment ‚Äî> Strong mates selected, less dominant & harmful genes will not be passed on
- adapt to changing env esp as env is changing faster due to man

## 448 Finding a Mate Steps - a summary

<aside>
üï∂Ô∏è (many selection mechanisms)

</aside>

1. Attract a mate (inter-sexual)
    - See Communication:
2. Stereotyped courtship and mating activities (inter-sexual):
    - Specific cues (isolating mechanisms) prevent crossbreeding and wasted energy on infertile matings
    - Get your mate into the right mood
3. Demonstration of greater fitness than rivals (intra/inter-sexual)
    - Usually males have to compete  but sometimes females do too
    - Monogamous species ‚Äì demonstrations that reflect nutrition and strength eg. Bird song, nuptial gifts, hunting displays
        - 90% of bird species are monogamous
        - A lot of mate selection by females is going on
    - Polygamous species ‚Äì forceful retention of females, fending off rivals (eg. Elephant seals) and exaggerated display (birds)
        - Dominant male has already been selected for so females don‚Äôt have to select
4. Arouse sexual motivation (inter-sexual)
    1. Sensory cues enhance sexual arousal
    2. Overcome aggression/predation, persuade to mate
    [i.Eg](http://i.eg/). Male hyena has to make sure female is not aggressive since female is larger and likely to swat away intruders
    3. Synchronize behaviour to allow mating

# ONE: Attract a mate

## Scent Display (chemical phermones in trilobite + beetles)

So we look at scent right i'm going to give you the example of this insect called the Trilobite larvae

- the female doesn't grow up, so it retains is larval form right and.

![glossary/Untitled%209.png](glossary/Untitled%209.png)

- **Neotenous -**  meaning that the adult retains the juvenile form, now the male beetle it metamorphosed and became a winged anymore right, so you can see, male and female, and the relative sizes something like this and also the females much larger than the male.
- raise her abdomen. So you can see, when the abdomen is raised she's actually wafting pheromones out of the rear.
- Attract male from kilometers away-  encounter the chemical molecules and he will fly in.
- Much smaller male, remains attached for many hours, fertilises 200 eggs ish, dies inside the female

So this is beetles should look like you know they... They hatch as larvae right, so they are like caterpillars or and then they're feeding feeding feeding accumulate fat and then they go Metamorphosise then come up completely different right as a beetle with wings. So this is a male and a female beetle and you can see where the red boxes it's showing how the abdomen of the male is bending towards the abdomen of the female so it does do internal fertilization. It does have a penis and insert into the female to fertilize right. So this is male and female and from here, you can tell from the position and that's the normal situation for beetles.

## 41: Visual Displays

Fireflies ‚Äî> can see in sg freshwater neesoon swamp. another courtship signal

Bowerbird: the bower bird, he's not like very brightly colored bc they let the courtship structure, do the talking right. they build a nest and decorate with whatever they find pleasign, and if the female bird likes it she'll mate with him.

## 83 Sound Displays

Nightingales + nightjar‚Üí call at night, little competition as most birds are diurnal

Strawheaded bulbul ‚Üí It's supposed to be distributed to Southeast Asia, but people all catch and keep the birds in a cage, but still common through Singapore!

Cicadas:

- after there's a larval stage live on trees. terminal moult has wings. Winged cicadas emerge through the back (split in the moult) Really small
- predictable outbreaks in temperate countries
- Sound is emerging through this thin panel right in the Center of the body and the abdomen is pushing air out through it.
- "cicada rain"
  - long proboscis to sip on tree water, almost half the body, which they insert into the tree trumk and tap the xylum vessels.
  - Density of nutrients is not high, so the water is excreted, and you'll see a puddle on the ground

Frogs + bats

- frogs are common along rail corridor, and can be as loud as cicadas.
- Bats echolocate (loud + high frequencies)
- Tungara frogs
  - male frog,smaller, hitchhikes, tungara frogs have two toned sounds if they are larger male frogs, else a single note if its small frog
  - Gravid females (swollen with eggs) hear potential consorts and they will swim to the males they choose. The selected male climbs aboard a female's back.
  - She carries him off to fertilize the eggs she will eject.
- But bats also prefer the larger frog and will go towards the larger sound
- 120 - Frogs, if they spot silhouette of the bat, then the frog is not going to call, ‚Äî> don't call when the predators is obviously around.
  - Frogs which see approaching bats stop calling, deflate their vocal sac, immerse deeper into water and finally dive and swim away
- bats can see ripples, and pounce at ripples more
  - so frogs all cluster together, if they're all calling at once, zooming in on a single male might be harder.

## 147: suicidal reproduction strategy

- All the males are soon gone... Leaving the females, to bring up the babies. OG thought: he sacrifices himself so more offspring will survive if he isn't there to compete for food.
- New research shows that they're actually doing it to promote their own genes over their competitors. And trying so hard to reproduce their bodies shutdown.
- 178: "intense mating season going on for about two weeks, and then they have a escalation of stress hormones, which causes the body tissues disintegrate, And they bleed internally, and then they all dropped dead."
- The sexual selection of the females, caues this
  - the females ovulate during a short period of time and is in high prey abundance, so the males if they want to be able to fertilize the female, they must be having sex at this time right and there's a lot of competition for a female. So then, if you have a high work rate then there's a high chance you're able to pass your genes along.

<aside>
üòì typical of species which have shorter mating seasons - they'll have very proportionally much larger testes so they pump out a lot of sperm within a short period of time

</aside>

# TWO: convince the mate to mate

## (11-404): Courtship behaviours lead to reproductive isolation

- Grebes courtship dance, so specific that another similar species will not be able to mate due to not knowing the courtship behaviour/sequence

## Why courtship signalling - Synchronity - Getting on the same page

Signalling that puts the mate in the appropriate mental state (chemical, tactile, etc)

Goals of synchronity:

- To achieve simultaneous release of sperm and egg (external fertilisation)
- To indicate readiness to mate to enable the approach of an aggressive female
- To invite a female to adopt a vulnerable position with an aggressive male.

# Getting Them In The Mood For Sex

- making sure the females of predator species (like hyenas and lions) won't fight but be willing
- To invite a female to adopt a vulnerable position with an aggressive male
  - hyenas, bowing, retreat at aggressive behaviours, persistence matters

### Make sure the time is right to mate

<aside>
üï∂Ô∏è courtship dances are interactive fixed action patterns.

</aside>

- Three-spined stickleback
  - he prepared a nest (stay at home husband,) put on a display and then entice the female with his zig-zag dancing (Fixed AP for female), stimulating egg deposition,
  - only then does the male release sperm, so since release of egg and sperm must be done at the same time, so, then the sperm will fertilize the egg that's out there
  - red colour will display as a territorial contest. key stimuli is red belly ‚Üí triggers a fixed action pattern
- Hyenas

# THREE: sexual selection

<aside>
üï∂Ô∏è tradeoffs. Loud and bright colours and displays work for the animals bc it shows their fitness but predators can catch on to this + its a lot of energy

</aside>

<aside>
1Ô∏è‚É£ Male Competition ‚Äî> males compete with each other for access to females: favours large size, armaments which enhance a males ability to fight

</aside>

## Bighorn Sheep

- Picture

    ![glossary/Untitled%205.png](glossary/Untitled%205.png)

- Prior to the mating season or "rut", rams attempt to establish a dominance hierarchy that determines access to ewes for mating.
- Testosterone peaks during the pre-rut (when social relationships are established) and declines from the pre-rut to the rut.
- Testosterone levels was correlated with social rank.

## Elephant seal

<aside>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Female Choice ‚Äî> males compete to win over a mate : favours characteristics the females find attractive like vivid colours, intricate courtship displays

</aside>

## Spiders

### Red-backed Spider

- Cannibalised males copulate longer.
- Fertilise more eggs than males that survive.
Females are more likely to reject subsequent suitors after consuming their first mate.
Thus redback males facilitate sexual cannibalism by shifting their abdomen above the female's fangs during copulation.
- However, males are not always successful.
Females often cannibalize smaller males during first copulation.
I.e. limiting paternity to 50% (one spermatheca).
Female control of paternity - mates with subsequent suitor

### Nephila genital plugs. man just breaks off his dick

- boxing glove shaped pedipalp genetalia, stuck inside the female opening. shoves sperm in and plugs the gap.
- males who have castrated themselves and removed their pedipalps are better fighters, and they stick around to protect their palpal plug
- they do use a lot of energy on those giant pedipalps (9% of body weight), but its worth it to make it safer
- males try to escape the females attempt to eat him, because he's just that much smaller.

## Sperm removal

Sperm removal (mechanical),
Sperm removal (female stimulation)
Sperm displacement (mechanical)
Sperm flushing (abundant ejaculate)
