# Human animal interaction

## 3 questions

1. whats the animal doing
    - flapping of the ears: confronting people ‚Üí show aggression
2. what is the environment like
3. what are the people doing
    - observe the fundamentals of giving the animal distance, etc

in musth ‚Üí elephant bulls will be more aggressive because they're in the mood to mate. attack random objects and people, gore trees etc

- usually in captivity they will chain up the bull then.
- if there are elephant rides, its always female elephants. but many places have stopped rides.

# Tree of Life - classifying animals

- note the kingdom, phylum, class, order

**SCIENTIFIC NAMES**

- Species name always *italicised* or underlined (differentiated).
- Genus name is capitalised (first letter in upper case).
- Specific epithet always in lower case.

# Innate and Learned Behaviours

Animals exhibit
i) innate responses (instinct; behaviours which ‚Äúdevelop without example or practise‚Äù

ii) learnt responses to stimuli

iii) or a combination of both

## Stimulus and response

<aside>
üß† All behaviour is a reaction to stimulus.

</aside>

- Take note of context: Singapore does have seasonality!
- Singapore has monsoon seasons. in february its one of the drier periods.

# Mechanisms of evolution - natural selection

fitness could be shown by how many offspring it hsa. the bishan park otters have 4-6 per litter, but the others do not?

<aside>
üìå A population has variance, evolution lets these variations be passed on

</aside>

## Territoriality

1. how strongly do you defend its area
2. how well does it train its young to fight
3. how often do they conduct patrols

## innate behaviour

- Simple behaviours that do not require thoght, they are things they just do instinctively.

Categories include

- orientation ‚Üí which direction they go (for example, direction babies go when they are  hatched)
- reflexes ‚Üí blinking, baby clenching ur finger, diving response
- Fixed action pattern ‚Äî> eg, the circular orientating of the beewolf wasp memorises where its nest is so that it can return. the positioning is important
  - other example, geese the roll their eggs ‚Üí which increases the survivals of the eggs.
  - regurgitation of herring gulls
  - whats important abt these fixed action patterns is that they are triggered by one v specific stimuli. once it is triggered, it cannot be stopped.
  - Open mouth ‚Üí stimulus for the parent to feed the chick.
- koels are hardwired to sound like koels, but some chicks learn to chirp from their parents.
- complex responses to stimuli
  - spotting males by colouration.

## Learning

- Adaptive change in individual behaviour is usually due to learning
  - example: otters who learn how to cross the road. this gives them more opportunities to move habitat

<aside>
üìå Habituation: when an author learns not to respond to a particular stimulus

</aside>

- the wild red junglefowl will flee, but if they get used to you they'll start to just ignore you.

Opposite of this is getting sensitised

- where they respond more strongly bc of trauma or strong experiences

Taming ‚Üí individual is taught via behavorial modification, easiest with young infants as they haven't learned fear, aggression, etc as much

Domestication ‚Üí favourable traits are chosen.

feral ‚Üí domestic species which was not socialised, so it acts wild.

## Conditioning

> Using stimuli to teach a certain response
>

is everything you do a result of external stimuli?

1. Shaping ‚Üí little stimuli which convinces you to do certain things, like the serotonin u get from purchasing certain things. Gradual training by reinforcement to manage bad behaviour
    - persuasion and reward, becoming sensitive to behaviour clues
2. imprinting : animal learning by fixating on a parent - or someone else!
    - Fillial imprinting convinces orphaned geese to migrate!
    - chicks that follow box, wellingtons, mother - depends on shape imprinted on
3. Latent learning: animal seems to learn without any particular purpose ‚Äî but actually, they are learning the terrain.

### play

practice adult activities with low consequences for failure. Activities practiced include

- play fighting ‚Äî> for territorial disputes, etc
- physical abilities

Types of play: 1) social play 2) excercise play 3) object oriented play

### social learning

- smelling the breath of the parent - figure out taste + what is edible. parents show them where to find food
- goal-learning emulation ‚Äî copy people, trying to follow the process and approach, stimulated by the possibility of a reward. this is also imitaiton.
- social learning increases fitness as its less dangerous, and takes less time
  - for instance if food might be poisonous its better to just watch others eat before oyu eat.
  - this allows animals to develop a shared culture
