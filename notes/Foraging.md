Diet depends on

- what can be consumed, on
- the nutritional needs of the forager
  - Forage to obtain energy & gather essential nutrients
- Specialized adaptations for collecting and digesting specific types of food.
  - Selection to avoid competition drive animals to choose foods that are relatively undigestible,
    - result in behavioral adaptations related to digestion like passing digestive symbionts among animals or gardening
        fungi.
  - Big cats, such as lions and tigers, have stealthy predatory behavior and strong pursuit abilities, adaptations that are accompanied by cryptic coloration, sharp claws, slicing teeth, short digestive tracts, and a digestive physiology evolved to handle a diet high in protein and fats.

Foraging behavior defines an animalâ€™s trophic niche, such as carnivory, within its ecological community.

# 2. Foraging is a series of discrete decisions

An adequate diet: gain enough energy to support growth, development, and reproduction â€¢ gain the right nutrients

E. g. Sodium limited herbivores inland

- Sweat bees
- Puddling by butterfliesâ‡’ supplement their diet.
  - When a butterflyâ€™s proboscis is unfurled and probing the ground for water and nutrients at water puddles, mud, dung or carrion they're not water-limited, they're looking for sodium and nitrogen, and they use visual cues to identify what they should be looking at.
    - The butterfly sips water rich in mineral salts and other essential nutrients that have leached from the surrounding soil and rocks.
    - the butterfly "pee" is actually practically pure water, because they're after the nutrients
  - Puddle for a few seconds to more than an hour (intoxicating)
  - Why?
    - A nectarivore diet lacks sodium, which (along with other minerals like nitrogen) is required for various functions, including flight and pheromones
  - Who?
    - Mostly younger males puddle; they are more active - need to locate receptive females
    - Nuptial gift to each female includes minerals, amino acids
  - Some butterflies want nitrogen, others want sodium
    - for sodium, the butterflies copy each other, thinking that the other one might have found the motherlode. they'll jostle for the best spots
    - for nitrogen they can Sense it
  - amino acids help them live longer lives.
- Salt licks visited by mammalian herbivores (geophagy)
  - eat soil, exposed minerals and salt
  - like spider monkeys!

â‡’ cats and dogs eating vegetation, not enough resources.

# Steps of Foraging

foraging consists of multiple steps:

1. search;
2. locate (incl. stalk),
3. iii) acquire (pursuit, subdue/kill);
4. iv) handle,
5. v) process and
6. vi) consume

## Learning by Trial Video

- Prey Selection
- Reduce distance
- Ambush
- Size
- Coordination
  - the cheetah's - 3 males, brought up together, trying to survive, goal is to pick out a weaker individual

## When does a cheetah hunt?

1. The presence of preferred prey (Thomsonâ€™s gazelle in particular) â€” a positive influence
    - Size, health, alertness of prey matters
2. The presence of competitors (e.g., lions and hyenas)â€”a negative influence
    - another animal might steal the kill from them
    - don't just focus on the quarry: good 360 check checking the horizon, saying, are there any lions,  a leopard even jackal  here
3. Energy needs
    - reflected in the presence of cubs or hunger level (indicated by belly size)â€”a positive influence
    - Pups will force you to hunt sooner rather than later,
4. Cover availabilityâ€”a positive influence
    - environmental condition should be favorable right so cover availability
    - a cheetah is very fast running, cannot sustain their speed forever. It's prey is also fast running so if you can approach closely before hand, then that is favorable
5. Time of day (preferred times are 700â€“800 hours and 1600â€“1800 hours)
    - not going to hunt at night â€” dangerous for fast moving animal to be running over bumpy land when you canâ€™t see the bumps.

ðŸ“Ž african savannah is very competitive. need to chase away othersand protect their young.

### Cheetah videos

- goal is to approach closely. Focus on a single prey.
- adult zebra can kill them,
- they have to be careful in those cases and target the young. It is best if they all attack the same prey â€” in the video with the three of them chasing different zebra, they weren't able to bring down the zebra bc the adult was able to defend them.
- the young are inexperienced and have to learn from the hunting trips. if they are unable to learn they will die out.
  - young needs to keep up with the mother or be left behind, OR
  - Pups stay behind, and stay hidden, watching the posture of the mother, cued by her when she is to come by a contact call.
- what the mother is doing
  - upright posture, quick movement says don't come
  - 6070 miles an hour 120 kilometers â€” if you get it wrong you break a leg.

ideal prey: thomson's gazelle: willingness to risk is because they are waiting for prey for their young. they're willing to run very long way because they know they'll probably succeed, especially if the prey is young in this case

- peaceful and calm around a meal, just get on with it.
- once the adult gazelle sees her, he's going to run.
  - the youngster will also be chasing after the mom.
  - mother picks out more prey even so, protects as the baby eats.

thomsons gazelle are predator satiation thing.

### hyena

- despite their reputation for scavengers they are strong predators.
- their prey is very large, but they can hunt and bring down prey by separating them from the rest of the pack
- spotted hyenas are relentless, separate the calf from the rest of the pack, then the parent would think, gg, and rejoin the pack
- the hyena pack will take down the calf and eat like the whole thing.
  - (scraps are carried off by ants)
- jackal pups interested in eating the hyena(?) but hyena doesn't wanna eat the jackal pups.

# 3. Diet choice and strategies and food handling

If you're a filter feeder in this case is anemone.

- picks up microscopic food particles or live animals which, which are very small and it's coming at it in the water column, so all directions, it just has to pick up.
- mostly immobile doesn't have to move around that much. they can relocate themselves, though.

### predator satiation

the parents may produce many defenseless offspring

- Examples: insects, thompson's gazelle.
- one individual producing many or many individuals population producing at the same time.
- Right, the vulnerable stages is not a frequent occurrence
- there is a trigger or time when a lot of the offspring appear, there's more than a predator can eat
- during that time when predator is satiated it means that some individuals will survive right, so this timing as lead to â€¦ especially in insect rights in Singapore, we don't have large animals you'll see there's a commonality about when the larvae will emerge much and many of them emerging matches.

Plants provide cues for flower-visiting animals: colour contrast, bait (nectar), nectar guides, prevent theft (species â€˜loyaltyâ€™ results in specific morphological adaptations)

## Herbivory

<box>
ðŸ“Œ distinguish between browsers and grazers.

</box>

- browsers (above ground; leaves, bark, stems; too high?)
- grazers (on ground; seasonal cover by snow?)

### Folivory - leaves, stems of plant

Animal tends to beÂ **less active**

- digestion process longer: Bigger digestion chambers (cellulose digestion),
- longer intestinal tract (extract breakdown product)

### Frugivory - fruit eaters

- **More active**Â species (need to find the fruit); shorter gut as extraction of fruit sugars is simpler
- Usually have full-colour vision: distinguish fruit
- Example: civet Cats.  The chemicals in the gut are good for breaking down to the seed,  and this is the ideal propagation situation for the fruit.

food handling â€”> deal with plant defenses

- (herbivory is not passive)
- Overcome defense: chemical, physical methods
  - buffalo tongue very rough to deal with tough plants
  - plants who redirect chemicals to the height that a grazer is eating them
- Always an arms race between predator and prey

## carnivory, insectivory

very active, competitive

**Heavy Competition** means:

- â€¢ establishing territory
- â€¢ prey selection
- â€¢ carnivore predation (includes infanticide)
- â€¢ cannibalism
- **pursuit**:
  - speed of cheetah, plummeting fish/insect-eating birds, dragonfly, or insect hunting spiders etc
  - track by steering
    - (while running, the cheetah's tail acts as a counter balance allowing it to make quick turns)
  - interception : aims for the front path
  - group hunting (see living in groups) (tradeoffs)
- **Stealth**
  - reduce the distance that you have to run
  - usually where there is good cover.
  - the weight of the animal is often a telling factor, allowing them to pin them down.

(Can be defeated)

via

- mobbing
  - harass it for along time and take nips at it throughout to wear it down and convince it it needs to escape
  - vocalization this is to harass animal

**Food handling** â€” deals with struggling animals, and you want to minimise harm

- suffocate, break/sever spinal cord
- inject venom,
  - komodo dragons, bite prey
- stalk prey

### Omnivory: generalists, intelligent, cooperative, exploratory

Urban adaptor:

- long tailed macaque
  - comfortable to move between forest patches through the city, will forage for food in the city too and that's why they stick around sometimes.
- compare sg two primates
  - banded leaf monkey
    - urban avoider (hides, v shy)

# 5. Optimal Patch Choice

Animals move from place to place, and in each location they might prey on different things. the places where they eat compose the home range together

## Marginal value theorem

- the animal moves about in a way from patch to patch, bc food is not uniformly distributed
  - decides how much food is in each place using latency and familiarity
  - stay until productivity starts to drop, then goes to eat at the next place when there isn't enough prey to be efficient
  - gives that area more time for it to recover.
- where an animal eats is its patch choice, what it eats when it is there is its prey choice.

### How long to stay in a patch? Charnov's marginal value theorem

<box>
ðŸ“Œ works via latent learning

</box>

1. how much food is in the next patch? (average richness of the patches in the area)
2. how far away is the next patch? (distance to the nearest patch that matches the average richness)

At some point, it becomes not productive enough, and it will move on.

- Some graph example:

    ![Foraging%20ec1ac/Untitled.png](Foraging%20ec1ac/Untitled.png)

example with chipmunks â€” tray place outside the chipmunk's burrow, quality of food and distance of food is varied.

- when there is better food, the chipmunks stay longer + as the seed tray is moved further away, the chipmunks also stay longer
- chipmunks stuff their cheeks longer as distance between seed tray and burrow increases (patch residence times correlate...)

---

When the patch quality drops, the predator will move on,  searching from site to site, because they want to find better patches.

# 6. Optimal Prey Choice

Redshank birds select for larger worms as they move along the shore. Doesn't have to be the largest worm, but because it is relatively more common it makes sense to do so.

We assume every animal decides to maximise energy gain (as quickly as possible)

Consider profitability of prey, P â€” you want the right size.

> P = E / (H + S)
P = amount of energy obtained from prey
Ã· time taken to eat prey    (handling)
Ã· time taken to find the prey    (search)
>

- Redshank birds were selecting for larger worms which were relatively uncommon, ignoring smaller worms
- Theory predicts well for immobile prey, some factors not considered.

# 7. Avoiding predation

# Optimal foraging

## Optimal Prey choice

- amount of energy obtained from prey
- Ã·Â time taken to eat prey (handling)
- Ã·Â time taken to find the prey (search)

# Avoiding predation

Baboons in multiple habitat environment

- 92-97% of time spent on food gathering; choice of habitats:
- 90% food found in woodlands (abundant)
- 10% riverbed (energy poor)

Predators = leopard and lions (stalk and rush amidst vegetation) â‡’ so the **woodlands** are **dangerous**, but the **riverbeds** are safe.

â‡’ where baboons spend their time depends on predation risk

- woodlands good food but high risk. varies a lot of time depending on what the group is like.
- if they're all males, they might be willing to live dangerously! and forage in the woodlands lol.
