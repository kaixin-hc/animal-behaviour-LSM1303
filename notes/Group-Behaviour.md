# Animal Groups

> An aggregation of individuals, of the same species, numbering two to the thousands, in permanent or temporary associations, in ordered or unordered groups, conferring some benefit to the individual

ðŸ“Œ cost VS benefit. When does natural selection favour a certain behaviour?

</aside>

Pay attention to : positions of males and females. position of the adults. benefits to the individuals (which is necessary in all social groups), size

example in otters: why a large group? the siblings are sticking around and competing for food, but they also protect the young, increasing the fitness.

size, big groups

- able to confuse predators.
  - predators like to react by focusing on just one, but thats often not enough
- group vigilance
  - individuals can reduce vigilance and focus more on feeding or reproduction
  - the larger group has a better coverage with more frequency of checks, but the individual spends less time
- defense by mobbing
  - even though the predator is stronger, the prey can confront the predator one after another in order to prevent it. the prey can do it again again to protect. this also determines reproductive fitness.

Solitary:

- independent

Pair:

- when they need help to take on parenting duties
- female blocks herself in to take care of the kid intensively, male brings food for the female + for the child. male will go after lizards, snakes, etc for the breeding female who will be hungryy

Arena Lek:

- the bats make noises to get the female bats to come, and the quality of their noises is what causes the women to decide to mate with them

hierarchy:

- when the hierarchy is established, they just need to mantain and this is less draining often.
- set in a dominance exercise when they create a new group
- observation might take a while before you are sure.

harems:

- In animals which live in harems, a new dominant male may engage in infanticide to ensure the females are able to mate and rear its young.

In multi-male coalitions, Males share females and offspring in a group. They may be related, hunt together with others, and females do not engage in patrolling the territory (?)
