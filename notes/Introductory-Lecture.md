# Project work

More than an academic exercise

- 14 hrs-28hrs hours for observation is v sizable, even though we are new - it can become a precursor to future studies for fulltime science students
- leopard cats : central catchment & western catchment nature reserve !! and they exist in pulau tekong etc

green patch - central catchment nature reserve. Freshwater crabs carry only a few eggs, and they're quite large - freshwater crabs take care of their young after they are hatched, so its large.

- practical 1 u do the map for local geography

10 minute presentation ‚Äî> which is a lot of time for your project LOL

- Projects must be non-interfering.

# idk what heading

### Roadkills

- collect roadkill to get good data for it
- can we encourage them to take crossings that will cause them to not die?
- Want to examine the gut or the fecal matter to figure out what the animals are eating. But its very tough to understand the food from the fecal matter rip because its all digersted.
- All the specimens go to the natural history museum - this helps with knowing where the animals exist.
  - natural history museum collection began with being inherited by the

### history

12 years of research (2008-2020)

- 100+ students
- (recent news!)Otters moving between singapore river, fort canning, & istana!

consultations with nature

<aside>
üè£ try to convince them to keep the best patch of nature to compromise with development. we all live in spaces where forests were cleared - and it makes way more sense to save the best patches of forest, rather than planting forest anew.

- Biodiversity roundtable of Singapore ‚Üí inform policies, wildlife and habitat management and development in singapore
  - examples of engagement in Singapore
    - cross island line project (LTA)
    - international coastal cleanup since 1997
    - habitat enhancement (OMT) ‚Äî> tree planting
      - when he was younger he saw a lot of loss ‚Äî internationally famous forest, half gone overnight.
      - dig a hole - the enhanced soil is put into the hole for the tree.
      - For two years, the ground around the tree must be cleared so as not to suffocate the tree
- NUS Toddycats since 2000
  - others: NUS PEACE, catcafe, nus veggies, vision of equality for a greener earth, etc
  - Ridgeview resendential college ‚Äî> interest in sustainability education
- Working groups: on certain animals Marine Turtle, freshwater crab, banded leaf monkey, wild pig, otter, long-tailed macaque, urban wildlife

Banded Leaf Monkey

- avoids being observed bc it is a prey animal for many many animals - even large birds!!

Flower Crab:

- they are carnivores and eat other crabs :0.

what eats crabs?

- snakes - when the crab is moulting. that hormone is detected by the snake so that the snake can break the crab in half.
  - david attenborough also made a documentary about that HAHA
- crabs eat crabs
- monitor lizards eat crabs

mudskippers ‚Üí lowtide changes to high tides, you can see the mudskippers fighting or chasing each other off

- mudskipper raises its dorsal fin
- swam in an arc and chased it away ‚Üí so you know these fish are missing.

water monitor lizards ‚Üí the monitor lizard has always been around.

Red jungle fowl:

- the male's crow is truncated
- Is able to fly
- Extremely shy

pro chicken and anti chicken group LOOOOL of the time.

## other animals we can't study lol

- dolphins (and pink dolphins!)
- dugongs (eat a TONNE of seagrass)
- turtles (turtle hatchlings released in the day - now they're debating raising. them up and then returning them when they cant be eaten
- otters

Temple Grandin ‚Üí animal welfare for cows - realised cows were prey animals, and were able to design enclosures with (less stimuli?), which encourages them to move with less use of the cattleprod. this is both kinder to cows and also makes economic sense.

# Wildlife in Singapore

## Forests

macritchie - does a juvenile macaque stay only with its mum? If a troop has 5 juveniles, every 15 minutes look up to record who the juveniles are interacting with. what % of time is the juvenile in contact with the mum?

- monkeys move in a kind of formation ‚Üí not just a random assemblage
- the males will just ignore you because tehy know whats up - but the young boys will come challgenge you HAHA
- mostly around the central catchment nature reserve
- Once in a while an indiv macaque will show up at a condo ‚áí impt to secure condo so macaque can't eat ‚áí else the macaque will hang around.
- At a certain point, the mom will kick her kids off LOL
- u need to tail the monkey troupe a while
- Juvenile will stick to the mum...or even +1 . Start with a question (whats the juvenile affinity for fellow troop members?) did the young hang out with anyone else?
- Coiton and post coital grooming
  - the male will chilly sniff the female's butt/area, they will do the do real fast LOL and the female is so detached, will look around, adopt a convenient position - then the female will groom the male.
  - if the woman don't want she'll just nope out LOL after he investigates.

You are too close to the animal if the animal looks at you. You want to be ignored by the monkeys. If the monkeys look at you thats too close.

- full frontal look ‚Äî a challenge alr.
- if you persist, the male will approach to protect the troop
  - then the macaque came to check u out also. So now you might become too close.
  - openmouth chill - is a normal submission pose. but the monkey went to challenge and YAWN ‚Äî> its a threat.
  - Warning call ‚Äî Krrrr (malay name is the same, like the sound they make

Ignoring ppl monkeys

- a monkey in kent ridge park that is totally silent ‚Üí
