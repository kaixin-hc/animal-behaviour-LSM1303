# Territoriality

---

home range — area in which an animal will normally live: space to find food, a mate, raise young, protect

- species are able to share space: zebras, impala, etc,
- a little bit of avoidance, signals, but overall they can coexist
- coatis, solitary males and female groups have a home range which overlap.

territoriality: must stay in the same place

<aside>
💡 how to tell? Map it out to see if its exclusive. cats followed exclusive territory— they will exclude new arrivals to some degree. territory is a space that is defended.

</aside>

- some animals, confined, can do with a smaller space, since they can get enough food.

# advertisement & defense

<aside>
💡 claim territory + attract

</aside>

even if it defecates, if the seeds are in the right condition... jelly like materials from inner gland is very pungent, and it shows as an advertisement to say Don't Come In. and this is for men and women → civets can advertise with their poop too

distant signals — advertisement via scent (tigers etc)

changeable lizards (advertisement by colour: ) advertising its territory

kingfisher: advertisement by sound —> that's how they maintain their boundaries

White Handed Gibbon: will also call (the males), to advertise. gibbons are widely dispersed, each occupy a valley, their territory

## Bird song at dawn

Dawn is when sound travels best

Dawn is also when animals break their fast,  from dusk the previous day

- Males may perch to amplify song – become visible and must must evade predators
- Many birds accumulate a repertoire of songs, even borrow from others – complexity indicates survivors of many seasons
- Males are hungry after a hungry night, and singing is energy intensive: reflects strength!

You can hear the complexity of songs - this is part of the indicators of fitness for birds.  

Siva: if you want to study the forests you can just record the sound in different places in Singapore,  and understand the richness.

## Proximal signals

→ otters: overt displays of aggression, chase and fight. dogs on land, otters in the water, taunting. even managed to draw the dogs into the water LOL. but the waters are a bit stronger. territorial displays between the two troops, then they both walk away, scoping out the edge of the territory.

→ birds: territorial displays or fights, common sandpipers.

<aside>
💡 territorial fights happen when you're establishing your territory

</aside>

<aside>
💡 and you still need to maintain their territory.

</aside>

Chimpanzees: line up in a line and patrol. the lines that are outside mean that you can slowly expand your territory.

→ chimpanzee catch and kill youngster, eat the chimp. why do they cannibalise the dead chimp? extra protein?

# Why acquire territory? Aim for optimality

<aside>
💡 optimality: if benefits > costs = fitness.

</aside>

## cost

- searching cost
  - dead otter by car
- mantainence cost
  - constant advertisement
  - vigilance by patrolling
    - Mitigated via ritualised combat evolved as it reduces costs of combative encounters for mates and territory, as contestants avoid severe harm.

### benefits

<aside>
📌 Reduce the dangers and disadvantages of crowding

</aside>

- Monopoly of food and nesting materials
  - (resources last longer, less depleted) + generally residents will be bigger
- Fighting reduced, energy saved due to territorial advertisement & dear enemy effect. (HOWEVER, NOTE THAT IN ONE OF THE QUIZZES HE SAID THAT FIGHTING WAS NOT REDUCED, AS THEY NEEDED TO DEFEND THEIR TERRITORY)
- Reduced promiscuity (multiple matings), family stable ⇒ increased guarantee of paternity
  - Ownership is a stimulant for breeding(?)
- promotes efficient exploitation
- reduction of disease: less crowding
- increase difficulty of predation bc they spread out
- parental preparation for next brood is easier as the young leave.
- familiarity with the environment (latenet learning)
  - home ground advantage: residents are easier to hide as compared to transients, you'll be more aware of the territory
  - deermouse and owls, deermouse survives more if they are residents as compared to transients

otters: Marina Bay & bishan park seem like prime areas

### always expand?

→ even if they have an opportunity to expand their territory, they might not: because the benefit won't outweigh the cost, its not worth it.

- Idea: Interactions are costly: energy is required
  - Even avoidance is costly if energy is expended but no resource is obtained
  - Energy spent is a cost, and the resources gained are benefits —> Optimal is where the curves meet

# Advertistment and defence

2.1 Distant signals – advertisement by scent, sound and visual displays
2.2 Proximal signals – overt displays of aggression, chase & fight
2.3 Maintaining territory: boundary patrols and vigilance

# territorial strategies

Exclusion — patrol and keep out neighbours

nasty enemy — increased aggression to neighbours, both need the territory

## dear enemy effect

Initial cost – neighbours compete and set up territorial boundaries. But there is stability after this “negotiation” and subsequently:

- less aggressive towards neighbours
  - Reduced fighting
  - Form a defensive coalition
  - Avoid attracting intruders
- maintain a tit for tat response. after you first establish your territory, you don't want to keep fighting because there's some stability. subsequently there is a reduce response towards neighbours.
  - a new neighbour is costly as you must renegotiate with a stranger
  - there chaos with renegotiation even though they're also out there.
  - when someone plays a territorial call there, they would just yell louder (heighten territorial response) until the stimulus stops, then they stop. AKA heightened aggression is temporary.

## What determines the outcome of battles

<aside>
💡 the body makeup (how many individuals) + coordination ⇒ hyenas able to push away a few animals, then the hyena is forced to give up the kill.

</aside>

(beverly & derrick Joubert, researchers in Africa)

- hyenas and lions fighting in the African savannahs, very aggressive towards each other, fight as soon as the groups accumulate. sunni finding difficult to get in.
- "the battle too fierce" → hyenas are aggressive and try to separate the lions. and push them away, so that the hyenas can eat the food.
  - hyenas engage in a mobbing action.
- males can turn the tide of the battle, but they'll often be patrolling, especially because of it.
- (the new hyena is trying to establish their territory - mark over where they are marking their territory, and harrassing the much larger lion.)
  - psychological warfare: goal is not food ⇒ just to get one up over their eternal enemies
    - spark a chase from teh lions who try to kill the hyena matriarch (and succeed)
      - cooperation here: the matriarch of the lions bit the female hyena first, and then the male came in to kill them

# Do territories ever shrink?

## Tidal territorial compression in giant mudskippers

student measured 4 individual mudskippers maintaining their territory at low tide. the mudskipper uses the low tide to hunt, with its eyes on the top of the head, able to walk around

<aside>
💡 mudskippers excavate the burrows, and navigate on their fins, and breath through their gills and skin when in the water. in water, fins just help them balance and navigate

</aside>

from their burrow and the surrounding areas, they lie in wait to ambush crabs.

the mom expands out and sucks using their mouth, and is a blessing to pounce on the animal, with its big mouth that is able to expand outwards.

- at high tide when the water comes out, they leave their burrows, which are widely spaced,
- and they are forced to be coming into a focused space, very difficult interactions coming on, displays are followed up with an attack.
- if they leave, they will climb up the trees and suck up water with their tail.

widely dispersed animal comes in and moves. don't need to resolve who is dominant.

## Natal Compression in smooth-coated otters

The territory of bishan had shrunk from august 2018 onwards. The Bishan group had an average, and then they had suddenly shrunk a great deal

- when the mom gives birth to pups, the whole family stops just to hang out with the pups and stay with her, in a compact territory which as shrunk
- very defensive → anyone who enters into that home, they would be able to
- the zouk otters came in to Singapore river to raise pups, because they finally had space.

4 weeks later

- they move their territory to a new space →
  - this is hypothesised to be because predators will also gain familiarity with teh pups, and will know that they will have a lot of problems?
- territorial confrontation when the grow again
  - when they're very coordinated, allows them to pursue v aggressively.

# Why do territory holders always win?

arbitrary rule hypothesis:

- resident always wins, because supply of resources are always high, and costs of fights is very high. the cost of a fight in the wild when you can get injured or die
- REJECTED:
  - This explanation was rejected because the resource (sunspots) is plentiful. Thus the attempts to acquire territories has no potential fitness payoff, and does not encouraging acquisition effort (not worth it) *Also removed residents were held in nets, so may been eager to escape than challenge.* Hence, this experiment was later rejected as evidence for an explanation

Resident is likely to be in a better condition

- size of the original resident is always much stronger ( generally much bigger) . territory owners in a certain area are at peak fitness: tested with insects.
- Resident is often more invested

## Symmetrical contests

wasps

When contestants are evenly matched, outcome depends on the contestant who is Willing to fight for longer compeition over sunspots might be very high, maybe you should eat Like, icrecream.

if a former resident fights a new ruling body, the residents generally wins.

Asymettrical theory:

- snowskinks in tasmania. the resident doesn't always win when they're the same size or even slightly higher, the resident generally won (72%). sunspot is critical, sunspot was critical for fitness
- the cases where they lost the other is much bigger.

# Types of Territory

6.1. Mating, nesting and feeding

- songbirds

6.2. Mating and nesting

- scarlet finch, the feeding ground is not contested

6.3. Mating (lek)

- lek: the only time they care about territory is during the lek

6.4. Nesting

- defend only immediate territories, like with seabirds, where there is a lot of competition from neighbours and they might even eat your chicks so you need to defend the arrea

6.5. Feeding territory

- varies with food supply female tigers in Nepal (ave 8 sq. miles) vs Russian Far East (200 sq. miles)
- activities associated with the boat, for example gulls who want the food tossed off from the boats — because it is a high quality resource

6.6. Roosting

- occupy same individual perches. they might fight for space in a certain space.
- there might not be enough trees or perch space

6.7.Winter territory

- territory changing due to the seasons

6.8. Deviates

- sharing territory: pied wagtail
  - defend riverside winter territories.
    - renewable food source, forage on insects that wash up on banks . wagtails forage in a cycle to allow replenishment
    - its like a replenishing buffet, where animals come up and be washed up. they will feed along bank A, then they will feed along bank B in a cycle.
  - intruders are sometimes tolerated.
    - they're okay with the intruder feeding, because they're eating on areas that are not optimal, in an area that you've already gone over one time.
    - the satellite bird (the one you're sharing with) —> helps to contribute to the defence of the territory.
    - Satellites are only tolerated when the food is high.
- bypassing territories: sneakers and satellites
  - fish reproduction: males build nests, attract females, protect nest. there is external fertilisation, egg and sperms released into the water. its true that there's synced pheromones that dictate this breeding, but people are sometimes able to sneak in
  - 3 types of fish
    - parental — older, territorial
      - (mature later, wait, able to control territory. ≥7 years old)
      - long lasting, low density sperm
      - testes sizes are the smallest
      - prioritise growth.
    - sneaker — younger, dart in and shed sperm
      - (precocious, steal, parasitic) (2-4 years)
      - varies between teh other two
      - big balls
        - guarantee that they will grow, highly competitive, high reproduction rate
    - satellite: intermediate age, mimic females, enter the territory slowly pretending to be a girl, and releasing the sperm. (4-6 years)
      - highest density and half the longevity. Higher density increase likelyhood of success
